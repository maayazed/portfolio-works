## Personal portfolio draft NOT applicable.
### Summary: Project does not meet guidelines.
Creators Note: This respository's function is incomplete. At best, chunks of code can be recycled for a later version when appropriate. The idea first was to implent a layout similar to the project called student landing page, an addon to a concept example. The drafting process, however for the basic layout without any screen adjustments, took too long, and the design test choices did not have a neutral pallete to work off of. The drafting process for the second layout used a wireframing guide from a online site called webflow. Code from both the live website and developer tools was replicated and adjusted to fit the layout visually sampled from webflow. https://webflow.com/. Again, the process took too long from adjusting both the live website and developer tool sampled code. Both versions were held to a envisioned example I am not cabable of, I learn best by mimicking, so completing this portfolio within a professional time is not possible for me. The time and resources spent would realistically not be considered to be professional, so this would not compete, which is what a portfolio is. A portfolio will be compelted in the future, but smaller tasks, smaller blocks of coding knowledge needs to be poished to be able to approach a completed portfolio project. Consider the provided code in this repository for criticism, not a practical employment application.
